# exercism-python
Public repo of [my implementations](http://exercism.io/unfo) of the Exercism.io Python exercises.

Trying to convert my brains from python 2.7 to 3.6.

# Note:
Exercism.io owns all copyrights to the README files of all exercises.   
I have added here to explain what the python scripts are for.

Original exercises can be seen at [Exercism.io/languages/python/exercises](http://exercism.io/languages/python/exercises)
